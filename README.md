# MORSE authentication tasks for ADO
This repository contains the implementation of the [ADO Authentication Tools
extension][1] for Azure DevOps.

There's a lot of annoying authentication issues when interacting with many cross
org assets in ADO. This holds a collection of tasks that can use an AAD service
principal to authenticate into ADO. The only requirement is that this service
principal must be added as a user to any orgs that should require access for it.
